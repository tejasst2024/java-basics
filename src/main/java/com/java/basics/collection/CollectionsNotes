1. Never use a for/foreach loop with Collections :
        -> as .remove/.add method modifies the existing collection
        -> foreach loop throws java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
        -> use an iterator(might throw UnsupportedOperationException check compatibility)
        -> or use different collection
        -> <collection>.removeIf("name"::equals)
        -> After declaring the iterator, fruits.add("Watermelon") will throw java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
  *A modCount is an int variable which counts the number of times this list has been structurally modified.
2. Parallel streams are used to process multiple cores.
3. Collections.emptyList is immutable (throws java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException)
4. If you're creating a sublist from a list, then any modifications made to sublist will affect the main list. This is called Backed collections.
    -> list - subList
    -> set - subSet
    -> map - subMap
